        Welcome to the South Coastâ€™s only indoor country music festival on a pier! Yep you read it right!<br>
        Country on the Coast was founded by Hannah Roper, aka Lily Garland, in conjunction with The Gaiety Southsea in 2018.<br>
        April 2019 saw the debut of the festival drawing in artists from across the UK and internationally and attendees from all over the UK.<br>
        As with all live music and events, Country on the Coast was hit by the global pandemic of 2020 but after 2 years of postponements and countless hours of effort, Country on the Coast 2022 went ahead and was a roaring success!
